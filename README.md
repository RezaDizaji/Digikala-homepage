# Digikala-homepage
Desktop version of old digikala.com homepage using HTML, CSS(SCSS) &amp; JavaScript.

I coded this project a few years ago, that's the reason why this is based on old design, but this is still very good example since it has custom made sliders by myself using JavaScript.
Please feel free to clone the project and complete it since tablet and mobile version is still incomplete and navigation menu can also be improved.
